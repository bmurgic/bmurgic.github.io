      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p>These are few of the hobbies or things I like to do in my past-time. I
        was always the type to get into things that allow you to create something
        unique, so that may explain why I like these.

              From regular keyboards that come with desktop computers and all the
              way up to keyboards made of full metal, I love them all. My main
              attraction to keyboards is how old of a mechanism it is, and yet we
              still use it everyday. I love customizing keyboards and making custom
              ones that have their own keycaps, switches, color, etc.

              Cars have always been something that I have loved since I was a kid.
              Whether it was looking at them in movies or real life, I always
              was amazed by them. I would draw them as a kid and later in life
              basically own my dream car. My dream car was a BMW M3, and it
              shaped my interest in cars even further to create a deeper interest.

              Photography is something that I have recently gotten into. Since I
              got my first sports car, I wanted to take pictures of it and catch
              the memories of it. I then later became good enough to take pictures
              of people and this would lead me to take pictures of my friends &
              family's personal things or lives.
