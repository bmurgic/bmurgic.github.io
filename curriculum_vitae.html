              From 2012 to 2016, I was being prepared for a position in the medical field.

              Taking this class between semesters at CSU East Bay, I was able to
              take some classes over the summer. This allowed me to save some time
              and money.

              When I first came to East Bay, I was a Nursing Undergrad. After completing
              all the prerequsites, I realized that it was not for me. I then switched
              over to Computer Science in 2019 when I thought it about it more.
              I realized that I was actually a lot more intersted and vested in that
              field. I am currently still a CS major and plan to finish in Spring of 2024.

              I spent about half a year working at Footlocker building up my communications
              skills. I was able to learn a wide range of skills when I was a Sales Associate
              here. After putting in a lot of work and getting top sales in my store
              and creating connections with other people.

              After I put in the work for Footlocker I moved to my family owned business
              Traveloko. Still working here, I am able to further increase my communication
              skills. Not only have I worked on these skills, but I also learned new ones
              with administration, technology, programming, organization, and leadership.
              Being the right hand for my parents in the business, I was able to get into
              the very difficult parts of running a trucking company. For example,
              I was in charge of insurance and taking care of all our equipment and drivers.
              This gave me a lot of knowledge as well to running a business, which
              will take me further in life and my ventures.
