      <div class="about-me">
        Thank you for coming to my website where you will see who I am. My name
        is Brandon Murgic and I am a Computer Science major at California State
        University of East Bay. I have been here since 2016 and still taking
        classes.
        </br>
        </br>
        I was born in 1998 so I really got to see the boom of technology
        from flip and touch screen phones to 1 foot and 1 inch thick monitors
        for computers. Because of this boom from the early 2000s and onward, I
        became in love with technology. Technology is one of the greatest things
        on this Earth simply because they allow you to create things and as well
        as increase productivity.
        </br>
        </br>
        Loving technology has made me who I am today, and is a core reason for
        why I am a CS major and always ahead of the curve when it comes to being
        advanced in life. Having this much knowledge and advancements in my life
        gives me the ability to create a life I envision.
        </br>
        </br>
        This leads me the my next point of who I am today, which is that I have
        hobbies based on this. I love cars, keyboards, and photography to name
        the most pertinent to me. Cars are not possible at all without
        technology and are so fascinating because of it. Keyboards are very old
        yet they are a part of our every day lives and is what we use constantly
        to control our computers. Lastly, for photography it gives us the ability
        to capture moments in life that would be otherwise be forgotten or
        misrememebred.
        </br>

        I work at my family's business that has to do with trucking. We are able
        to work with brokers and drivers in order to deliver goods all across
        the United States. As you can imagine, this can be very confusing and
        clutterd with paperwork and documentation. Since we are ahead of the curve
        with technology, not just as myself but my family, we created a piece of
        software to manage a company like this. This is where we allowed ourselves
        to get creative and figure out what a company like ours would need in
        order to run smoothly and efficiently. I am currently today still working
        with my family on this software and always improving it.
        </br>
        </br>
        I did not start here though, but actually at Footlocker where I worked as
        a Sales Associate. This gave me customer service and communication skills
        that you are not able to just be born with. From this, it made me grow
        as a person and give me the confidence to pursue other paths in life.
        </br>

        Please enjoy the content that I have put into this website, and feel free
        to contact me on the Contact Me page I have created. Every page took
        careful consideration on how it was made and definitely allowed me to be
        creative.

        Thank you.
